            <p>
                <blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During my childhood, teenage, and college years, I have developed a skill set that I
                could call a valuable asset.<sup>1</sup> I can say that I am proficient in using various programming language, Although not very
                good yet and still learning.<sup>2</sup> I have experienced using different kind of programming language.<sup>3</sup>
                When I was in my senior high school I took the strand <abbr title="Information Communications Technology">ICT</abbr> strand which includes 
                different kind subjects.<sup>4</sup> Softwares and hardwares, including programming and basic computer repairs.<sup>5</sup>
                My very first programming language I learned is <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and basic <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>
                with a little bit of JavaScript.<sup>6</sup> Because of this experience, I developed skill that is useful for Web Development and Web Designing.<sup>7</sup>
                In my freshman year, I further improved my problem solving & critical-thinking skills because the programming language we used at programming subject is Python and Java.<sup>8</sup> 
                Which requires high problem solving & critical-thinking skills to understand and to provide the solution to the problem given by the professors.<sup>9</sup> 
                I also improved my skills on using Word Processing applications, because of the different kinds of school works and activities.<sup>10</sup> I also learned
                how to collaborate effectively with my group members during groupworks.<sup><b>11</b></sup> Which also improved my Teamwork and Communication skills.<sup>12</sup> 
                While in college, I learned the most important skill to survive, which is the Adaptability of any situation and the Willingness to Learn new things.<sup>13</sup> 
                There is also my Time management skill that allows me to finish my pending activities on time.<sup>14</sup> I belive when facing incredible challenges our skills shines brightly.<sup>15</sup> 
                Talent is just a ingredient of Skills.<sup>16</sup> Improving our own skill set further would help us to achieve greater things.<sup>17</sup> Result is just a 
                byproduct of what the skills could do.<sup>18</sup> That is why, I am continously working to enchance my skill sets to stay ahead in my field.<sup>19</sup> My dedication
                and passion for what I do drive me to survive every challenges I face.<sup>20</sup>

            <blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have variety of hobbies that keep me engaged, help relax, and allow me to explore my self. <sup>1</sup> 
                My favorite among all the hobbies I have is playing Online Games.<sup>2</sup> 
                Whether it is a competitive or for fun games, I like playing Online Games because it helps me relieve my stress.<sup>3</sup>
                When playing I feel like I am outside of the real world and free from all the stress of life.<sup>4</sup> 
                Maybe it is just because I happened to born where technology excels the most. <sup>5</sup> 
                I also love playing Online Games because it allows me to connect with my relatives and friends.<sup>6</sup> 
                It also helps me explore my mind when it comes to programming.<sup>7</sup>
                When I am playing Online Games I often wonder how do they create such game with good graphics and how hard it is to create such thing.<sup>8</sup>
                In my free time, I am trying to create a functional game using the programming language that I learned in school.<sup>9</sup> 
                Although it is hard, it is quite enjoyable for me.<sup>10</sup> I also enjoy reading manhwas, manhua, and manga.<sup>11</sup> 
                Reading them gives me idea and makes my mind more creative.<sup>12</sup> 
                Since most manhwas are digitally created, it makes me want to create one.<sup>13</sup>
                But it requires high level of drawing skills and creative mind which are skills that I don't have so I never really tried creating one.<sup>14</sup> 
                I also like watching reviews of new gadgets such as phones, laptops, and computer desktop.<sup>15</sup>
                When I was in senior high school, Cycling is one of my hobbies.<sup>16</sup> 
                As it gives me a sense of freedom and adventure, Although sometimes it is scary because highways have many trucks and cars.<sup>17</sup>
                I also love spending my free time with my friends and families.<sup>18</sup> Because of my love of spending free time with them, I often organize
                small gathering with them.<sup>19</sup> My hobbies help me maintain a balanced lifestyle, keep me motivated in different aspects of life and make my mind rest even in the most stressful part of my life.<sup>20</sup>

            <p>
                I have always been fascinated by technology, which is why I chose to study Information Technology in college.<sup>1</sup>
                Being 19 years old, I am at a stage where I constantly seek knowledge and enjoy discovering new things.<sup>2</sup>
                My curiosity drives me to explore different areas of IT, from programming to cybersecurity.<sup>3</sup> 
                Aside from academics, I have a strong passion for online gaming.<sup>4</sup> 
                Playing games allows me to unwind and connect with friends from different parts of the world.<sup>5</sup> 
                I enjoy the thrill of competitive matches and the strategy involved in each game.<sup>6</sup> 
                Exploring new games excites me because each one offers a unique experience and challenges. <sup>7</sup> 
                I also like to experiment with game mechanics and understand how they are designed.<sup>8</sup> 
                Beyond gaming, I enjoy learning new skills related to technology.<sup>9</sup> 
                I have tried coding in different languages, and I find it satisfying when I successfully build something.<sup>10</sup> 
                Web development is another area that interests me because creating functional websites feels rewarding.<sup>11</sup> 
                I also explore hardware and software, trying to understand how systems work together.<sup>12</sup> 
                Problem-solving is one of my strengths, and I like troubleshooting technical issues.<sup>13</sup> 
                Learning about artificial intelligence and machine learning has also sparked my curiosity.<sup>14</sup> 
                I believe that keeping up with new technology trends will benefit my future career.<sup>15</sup> 
                In my free time, I watch tech-related videos and tutorials to expand my knowledge.<sup>16</sup> 
                I also enjoy reading about innovations that shape the world of IT.<sup>17</sup> 
                Sometimes, I experiment with different software and applications to see what they can do.<sup>18</sup> 
                Aside from technology, I like to explore new places and try new food.<sup>19</sup> 
                Experiencing different cultures and traditions is something I look forward to in the future.<sup>20</sup> 
                Being open to new experiences allows me to grow as a person.<sup>21</sup> 
                I believe that my love for technology and exploration will help me achieve great things.<sup>22</sup> 
                My goal is to continue learning and improving my skills so that I can contribute to the ever-evolving tech industry.<sup>23</sup>
