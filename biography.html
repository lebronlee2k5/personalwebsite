            <blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am Lebron Lee C. Setosta and I live in Tondo, Manila.<b><sup>1</sup></b> I was born on September 
                23, 2005  at Jose R. Reyes Memorial Medical Center in Tondo, Manila but not long after 
                I was born we moved to Binmaley, Pangasinan.<b><sup>2</sup></b> We moved because my parents 
                separated and I moved with my mom along with my older sister.<b><sup>3</sup></b> I was raised in 
                Binmaley, Pangasinan until I was 6 years old.<b><sup>4</sup></b> I spent half of my childhood in 
                Pangasinan with my mom and my grandparents on my mother's side.<b><sup>5</sup></b> In those 6 years, 
                I am so weak that most of the time I am sick.<b><sup>6</sup></b> I cannot play outside for long with other 
                children because I have asthma and I cannot get too tired from playing.<b><sup>7</sup></b> I remember 
                one day when I was playing more than usual.<b><sup>8</sup></b>  Later that day, I had a serious asthma 
                attack, and I know my mom and grandparents were up all night, worried sick and 
                making sure I was okay.<b><sup>9</sup></b> Living in the province without proper work and income was 
                hard.<b><sup>10</sup></b> Our only income was from selling necessary daily things at the market, with a 
                family where there are many members, that income was so little.<b><sup>11</sup></b> Although, living there 
                was fun for a child with no knowledge about expenses but for the adults it was hard.<b><sup>12</sup></b> At 
                that time my father was not supporting us financially at all, making it more difficult for 
                my mom.<b><sup>13</sup></b> I also started my education that time and my sister is at High School.<b><sup>14</sup></b> I 
                finished my kindergarten, preparatory and grade one in Pangasinan.<b><sup>15</sup></b> Since life was 
                challenging in the province, my mom sought opportunities elsewhere to support my 
                sister and me.<b><sup>16</sup></b> She decided to work overseas and applied for a job in Riyadh, Saudi 
                Arabia.<b><sup>17</sup></b> 2012 was the year my mom went to Saudi Arabia. I was little then, and since I 
                didn't know where she was going, I kind of felt like she'd just left and didn't love us 
                anymore.<b><sup>18</sup></b> Around that time, we moved back to Manila, and I also met my father for the 
                first time.<b><sup>19</sup></b> Since my mom was going to work abroad, they agreed that we would live 
                with him.<b><sup>20</sup></b></blockquote>

                <blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Years later, I learned that my mom didn't say goodbye because she knew I 
                    wouldn't understand and would just cry and beg her to stay.<b><sup>1</sup></b> I was an early teen when I 
                    saw my mom again.<b><sup>2</sup></b> It was after I graduated from my Elementary education.<b><sup>3</sup></b> My 
                    teenage life is not as boring as my childhood.<b><sup>4</sup></b> I donâ€™t get sick that much anymore, I 
                    made a lot of new friends, met a lot of amazing people, fell in love, experienced 
                    heartbreak and many new experiences that shaped the current me<b><sup>5</sup></b> I remember being 
                    in seventh grade and experiencing that whole "first love" thing.<b><sup>6</sup></b> It began with just 
                    admiring her from afar, but soon I was completely smitten.<b><sup>7</sup></b> Seeing her in the hallways 
                    would make my heart race.<b><sup>8</sup></b> I tried to confess and pursue her but she rejected me, it 
                    was my first rejection and also my first heartbreak.<b><sup>9</sup></b> Although she rejected me, my 
                    feelings for her stayed, years have passed and I still admired her from afar.<b><sup>10</sup></b> In my 
                    eighth grade days, my mind became more open, I started doing things for fun.<b><sup>11</sup></b> Doing 
                    things such as joining school section competitions and joining intramural sports 
                    competitions.<b><sup>12</sup></b> Eighth grade was also a big year for me â€“ I made the top 10 for the first 
                    time in high school.<b><sup>13</sup></b> I'd missed too much attendance in seventh grade to qualify, but I 
                    was <em>determined</em> to do better.<b><sup>14</sup></b> I was proud of myself that time.<b><sup>15</sup></b> In my ninth grade I am 
                    more active, because I want to do more things that I could be proud of, but before my 
                    ninth grade ends.<b><sup>16</sup></b> Pandemic happened, during the pandemic a lot of things have 
                    changed.<b><sup>17</sup></b> It feels like my teenage years were wasted during that time.<b><sup>18</sup></b> I graduated my 
                    Junior High School online and to me it feels like not an achievement.<b><sup>19</sup></b> I enrolled as an 
                    <abbr title="Information and Communications Technology">ICT</abbr> strand student, I started and ended my eleventh grade via online class, because of 
                    the pandemic it feels like time skipped and made me a grade 12.<b><sup>20</sup></b> In my twelfth grade, 
                    life is starting to go back to normal and I graduated my Senior High with Honors and 
                    Best in Research Award.<b><sup>21</sup></b></blockquote>
